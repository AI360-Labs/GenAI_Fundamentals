Defining structured invoice data models with comprehensive validation\n","2. **Field Validators**: Custom date validation supporting multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, etc.)\n","3. **Enum Types**: CurrencyEnum restricting values to top 10 global currencies\n","4. **Date Handling**: Flexible date parsing from various formats to standardized YYYY-MM-DD\n","5. **Structured Output**: Enforcing JSON schema compliance with Gemini API\n","6. **Batch Processing**: Processing 20 invoices with systematic comparison\n","7. **Field-Level Accuracy**: Detailed validation showing per-field performance metrics\n","8. **OCR Integration**: Extracting structured data from unstructured invoice text\n","9. **Ground Truth Comparison**: Systematic validation against known correct data\n","10. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing fields and invalid data\n","\n","### 💡 Best Practices Demonstrated\n","\n","- ✅ **Comprehensive field definitions** with clear descriptions and validation rules\n","- ✅ **Flexible date validation** supporting 12+ different date formats\n","- ✅ **Currency standardization** using enum for consistent data quality\n","- ✅ **Systematic field comparison** with normalization for text fields\n","- ✅ **Batch processing with progress tracking** using tqdm\n","- ✅ **Rate limiting** with sleep delays to respect API limits\n","- ✅ **Detailed accuracy reporting** at both field and overall levels\n","- ✅ **Null handling** for missing or unclear data fields\n","\n","\n","### 🎯 Next Steps\n","\n","- 🔹 Implement field-level accuracy
