The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\n","years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\n","years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\n","her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\n","of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\n","intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\n","unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their\n","being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\n","well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\n","interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\n","in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\n","every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\n","as could never find fault.

She dearly loved her father, but he\n","was no companion for her.\n","\n","======================================================================\n","\n","======================================================================\n","CHUNK 6 (59 characters)\n","======================================================================\n","He could not meet her in conversation,\n","rational or playful.\n","\n","======================================================================\n","\n","======================================================================\n","CHUNK 7 (1010 characters)\n","======================================================================\n","The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\n","not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\n","for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\n","of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\n","and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\n","and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\n","at any time.
